IMPORTANT: Please ensure you have already created the pdda database as found in pdda_v2/database/Instructions.txt
and completed all of the steps BEFORE running these database table creation scripts. 

open SQL Shell (psql)
Server: localhost
Database: pdda
Port: 5432
Username: postgres
Password: postgres

Use \cd to navigate to the directory with the scripts e.g.
\cd /Users/chrisvincent/git/pdm/database_pdm_poc

Can use \! pwd to indicate the working directory

Run this FIRST! this makes absolutely sure you are using the pdda schema
or all the tables get added in the default 'postgres' database which is not ideal
\c pdda

Install DB objects (tables, constraints, triggers, packages, refdata etc.):
\i 'pdm_db_install.sql'

Refresh the database using the temp tables (pdm-create-temp-tables.sql is in the temp folder):
\i 'pdm-create-temp-tables.sql'
\i 'pdm-refdata-refresh.sql'

Example of BLOB data load (script generated using ORA2PG) from data folder
\i 'test-blob-data.sql'

There are some additional scripts in the optional folder that can be used for additional test data
and a script that refreshes the XHB_DM_QZ_* Quartz Scheduler tables.

\cd optional
\i 'reload_xhb_dm_qz_tables.sql'

To load the additional test data for development purposes you will need to load the additional CDU, Court Site and Local Proxy data.
\i 'load_additional_court_site_local_proxy_data.sql'
\i 'load_additional_cdu_data.sql'

To generate the sonarqube remote a database needs to be created via the following command:

\i 'create-sonarqube-db.sql'
